Mistral Model Usage Guide

1. Installation

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Install the required packages using pip:

pip install transformers sentencepiece

2. Usage

Import the required libraries in your Python script or notebook:

from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

Load the Mistral model and tokenizer using the AutoModelForCausalLM and AutoTokenizer classes:

model_name = "filipealmeida/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-sharded"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

Generate text based on your input prompt:

prompt = "Write an essay on the culture and tradition of Nepal in 300 words."
encoded_prompt = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt", add_special_tokens=False)
output = model.generate(**encoded_prompt, max_length=200, num_return_sequences=1, do_sample=True)
decoded_output = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(decoded_output)

3. Customization

You can adjust the max_length, num_return_sequences, and other parameters of the generate method according to your requirements.

4. Running the Script

Run your script or notebook, and you should see the generated text based on the Mistral model.
